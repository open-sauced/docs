Welcome to our [#100DaysOfOSS series](https://dev.to/opensauced/100daysofoss-growing-skills-and-real-world-experience-3o5k). Until October 31, we'll be doing  Open Source Software (OSS) terms from A to Z. We'll be diving into a different letter of the English alphabet, uncovering OSS concepts, and sharing our thoughts on them.

Today, we're covering the letter "I" for Issues. 

**Issues**: An issue is a problem, suggestion, or task related to a repository that is tracked and managed using issue tracking systems.

An issue can have a wide range of topics, including:

**Bugs**: A bug report documents when software behaves unexpectedly, crashes, or produces incorrect results. Bug reports help developers identify, replicate, and fix the issues.

**Feature Requests**: Users or contributors can propose new features, enhancements, or changes to the code or software. These requests are used to discuss and prioritize potential additions to the project.

**Enhancements**: Similar to feature requests, these suggestions aim to improve the software's functionality, performance, or user experience. They might not introduce entirely new features but can involve refining existing ones.

**Documentation**: Issues related to improving or clarifying the software's documentation. This could involve fixing errors, adding missing information, or making instructions more understandable.

Now, we want to hear from you! What other OSS terms can you think of that start with the letter "I"?
