Welcome to our [#100DaysOfOSS series](https://dev.to/opensauced/100daysofoss-growing-skills-and-real-world-experience-3o5k). Until October 31, we'll be doing  Open Source Software (OSS) terms from A to Z. We'll be diving into a different letter of the English alphabet, uncovering OSS concepts, and sharing our thoughts on them.

Today, we're covering the letter "M" for Meritocracy.

**Meritocracy**: Open-source communities often operate on a meritocratic model, where contributors' influence and decision-making authority are based on their demonstrated skills, knowledge, and contributions to the project.

Now, we want to hear from you! What other OSS terms can you think of that start with the letter "M"?
