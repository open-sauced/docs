Welcome to our [#100DaysOfOSS series](https://dev.to/opensauced/100daysofoss-growing-skills-and-real-world-experience-3o5k). Until October 31, we'll be doing  Open Source Software (OSS) terms from A to Z. We'll be diving into a different letter of the English alphabet, uncovering OSS concepts, and sharing our thoughts on them.

Today, we're covering the letter "R" for Repository.

**Repository**: A repository is a central location where open-source projects store their source code, documentation, and related files. Platforms like GitHub and GitLab provide hosting services for repositories.

If you want to practice creating your own repository, check out [Practice Contributing with VS Code](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/04-tools-to-be-successful?id=practicing-contributing-with-vs-code) in our intro to open source course.

Now, we want to hear from you! What other OSS terms can you think of that start with the letter "R"?
