Welcome to our [#100DaysOfOSS series](https://dev.to/opensauced/100daysofoss-growing-skills-and-real-world-experience-3o5k). Until October 31, we'll be doing  Open Source Software (OSS) terms from A to Z. We'll be diving into a different letter of the English alphabet, uncovering OSS concepts, and sharing our thoughts on them.

Today, we're covering the letter "X" for Xenial Xerus.

**Xenial Xerus**: Ubuntu versions are named alphabetically with an adjective and an animal, and "Xenial Xerus" is the name for the 16.04 release. 

This was a hard one! Now, we want to hear from you! What other OSS terms can you think of that start with the letter "X"? 

Remember to use the hashtag #100DaysOfOSS if you share on social media, and don't forget to tag us [@saucedopen](https://twitter.com/saucedopen) so we can follow along.
