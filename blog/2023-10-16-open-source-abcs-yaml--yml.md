Welcome to our [#100DaysOfOSS series](https://dev.to/opensauced/100daysofoss-growing-skills-and-real-world-experience-3o5k). Until October 31, we'll be doing  Open Source Software (OSS) terms from A to Z. We'll be diving into a different letter of the English alphabet, uncovering OSS concepts, and sharing our thoughts on them.

Today, we're covering the letter "Y" and the difference between YAML and YML.

<!-- truncate -->


- **YAML**: Stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language." YAML refers to the data serialization standard itself. When you're talking about the language or the format, "YAML" is the term to use.

- **YML**: A file extension commonly used for files that contain YAML-formatted data.

You might see .yml or .yaml as file extensions. Both indicate that the file contains YAML-formatted data.
Both .yml and .yaml are acceptable file extensions, and there's no difference in functionality. It's generally a good practice to stay consistent with the file extension you choose for a given project.

Now, we want to hear from you! What other OSS terms can you think of that start with the letter "Y"?
