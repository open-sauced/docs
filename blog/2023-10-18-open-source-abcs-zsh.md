Welcome to our [#100DaysOfOSS series](https://dev.to/opensauced/100daysofoss-growing-skills-and-real-world-experience-3o5k). With this post, we've officially gone from A to Z!

Today, we're covering the letter "Z."

- **Zsh**: Zsh, also known as the Z Shell, is an interactive login shell for Unix-like operating systems. It includes many features to improve productivity, such as advanced tab completion, spelling correction, and a flexible plugin and theming system. Zsh is often favored by developers for its customization capabilities and is commonly used in open source software development environments.

Now, we want to hear from you! What other OSS terms can you think of that start with the letter "Z"?
