Welcome to Day 9 of our [#100DaysOfOSS series](https://dev.to/opensauced/100daysofoss-growing-skills-and-real-world-experience-3o5k). Until October 31, we'll be doing  Open Source Software (OSS) terms from A to Z. We'll be diving into a different letter of the English alphabet, uncovering OSS concepts, and sharing our thoughts on them.

Today, we're covering the letter "C" for Collaboration.

**Collaboration**: Collaboration is at the heart of open source. It's the cooperative effort among developers, contributors, and users to improve and enhance open source projects through shared knowledge and contributions.

Now, we want to hear from you! What other OSS terms can you think of that start with the letter "C"?
