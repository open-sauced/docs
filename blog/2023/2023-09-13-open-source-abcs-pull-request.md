Welcome to our [#100DaysOfOSS series](https://dev.to/opensauced/100daysofoss-growing-skills-and-real-world-experience-3o5k). Until October 31, we'll be doing  Open Source Software (OSS) terms from A to Z. We'll be diving into a different letter of the English alphabet, uncovering OSS concepts, and sharing our thoughts on them.

Today, we're covering the letter "P" for Pull Request.
