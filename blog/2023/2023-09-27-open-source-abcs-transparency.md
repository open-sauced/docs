Today, we're covering the letter "T" for Transparency.

**Transparency**: Transparency helps to build trust in open source. Because open source is a collaborative effort, with people from all over the world coming together to develop and maintain projects, transparency is one of the most important strengths of the open source community. 

Now, we want to hear from you! What other OSS terms can you think of that start with the letter "T"?
