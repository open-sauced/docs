*Today is day 29 of my 29 Days of Open Source Alternatives series, where I explored open source alternatives to proprietary software in the categories of Game Development and Multimedia, Development Tools and Platforms, Productivity and Collaboration Tools, and more. If you'd like to see the full list of the open source alternatives I covered, head over to my [29 Days of Open Source Alts Page](https://oss.fyi/oss-alts).*

It's been almost a year since I started at OpenSauced. It's incredible how much we've grown and accomplished over that year. I say this very genuinely. Our team looks at problems and finds ways to solve them. We think about the users and how we can provide them value. We [understand the importance of Open Source Insights](https://opensauced.pizza/blog/bridging-the-gap-organizational-insights), especially since GitHub deprecated their Activity Overview of Organization Insights on January 5. We recognize the [importance of recognizing contributors](https://opensauced.pizza/blog/the-need-for-recognition-in-open-source) and [recognizing maintainers](https://opensauced.pizza/blog/the-lonely-journey-of-open-source-maintainers). This is a bit of a meta blog post. I want to take the time to recognize my team and the great contributors we have.

## Our Teams

Our teams have been really hard at work launching a new features for OpenSauced called [workspaces](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/features/workspaces/) and that's reflected in the contributor insights page below.

### Engineering

### Docs

As one of the docs maintainers for OpenSauced, I find it helpful to track our docs team to make sure I'm supporting them and to see the progress we're making. (You'll see some *huge* work shipped from this team in the next couple of weeks on the [Intro Repo](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro), when we launch our maintainer course!)
