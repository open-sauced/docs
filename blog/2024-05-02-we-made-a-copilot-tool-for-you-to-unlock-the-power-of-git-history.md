### A Solution to Sourcing Talent

Recently, Adam Wathan of Tailwind CSS expressed a challenge: attracting applicants well-versed in a niche combination (Rust and Tailwind) despite offering competitive salaries. 

Inspired by this challenge, we asked ourselves, "Wouldn't it be cool if we built something to find this persona?" StarSearch allows you to get answers to your questions even when you don't have the context. The context for this question: most of the developers on the list work on front-end focused teams with an interest in developer performance. 
Weâ€™re not just another tool; we're here to redefine the meaning of open source. 

Let's uncover the stories behind the code together - [Join the Waitlist Today](https://oss.fyi/starsearch-waitlist) and share with your friends.
