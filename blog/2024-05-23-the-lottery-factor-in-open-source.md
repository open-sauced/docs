My team at OpenSauced has been working really hard on a new feature called StarSearch. With StarSearch, you can get otherwise hard to discover information about open source projects and contributors. 

> **Weâ€™re live on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/opensauced)! Join the conversation and let us know what features you'd like to see added.**

In this demo, I talk about the lottery factor - the risk if one of your top contributors leaves a project - and take a look at how Laravel fairs.
