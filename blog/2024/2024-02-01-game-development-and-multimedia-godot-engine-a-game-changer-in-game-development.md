*Today starts my 29 Days of Open Source Alternatives series, where I'll be exploring open source alternatives to proprietary software in the categories of Game Development and Multimedia, Development Tools and Platforms, Productivity and Collaboration Tools, and more. If you'd like to see the list of the open source alternatives I'll be covering this month, head over to my [29 Days of Open Source Alts Page](https://oss.fyi/oss-alts) or check out my [list of open source games](https://oss.fyi/oss-games).* 

<hr/>

Last year, we decided to homeschool my 13 year old for a semester. When he told me that he was really interested in game development, I installed all things Unity and tried to get him up and running. 

Narrator: *we never got things up in running.*

We navigated a lot of error messages, challenges, and finally gave up with disappointment. Fast forward six months and I started to hear more and more good things about Godot. Full disclosure: we haven't gotten anything up and running (yet), but we've been navigating a new landscape of game development that has long been dominated by proprietary engines. 

> Godot is a free and open source, cross-platform game engine that allows you to create both 2D and 3D games.

[Godot](https://godotengine.org) is the open source engine that gained a huge boost in popularity earlier this year when Unity announced changes to its pricing. Unlike its paid counterparts--Unity and Unreal Engine--Godot champions accessibility, robust features and an intuitive workflow. Whether you're experienced or new to game dev, Godot offers a positive and community-driven developer experience.

## Godot vs. Proprietary Engines

Godot differentiates itself from proprietary engines like Unity and Unreal Engine through freedom and flexibility. Its open source nature decreases the financial barriers that impede creative game development exploration while still providing quality tools and experience. It has a  comprehensive suite of tools for 2D and 3D game development. From robust physics simulations to seamless cross-platform compatibility, Godot brings the same power as its competitors, but is accessible and often easy to use. Its been noted that using its scripting language, GDScript, a Python-like language, makes it approachable for beginners but also powerful enough for experienced developers.

## Customization and Creativity with Godot's Flexible Tools

One of Godot's greatest strengths is its adaptability to different developers' needs. Whether you prefer coding in GDScript, C#, or C++, Godot offers a range of options. Its node-based system lends itself to those who use a visual development environment, with its drag-and-drop actions. Beyond the core capabilities, the engine's architecture allows for extensive customization through plugins and extensions. This flexibility ensures that each developer can tailor Godot to their specific project requirement.

## Open Source Support & Popularity

With over 80,000 stars on GitHub, an enthusiastic community forking and contributing to the code, and an open-source MIT license empowering creativity, Godot is more than just a game engine; it's a thriving ecosystem where developers collaborate, innovate, and build the future of gaming, one pixel at a time.

- - Stars: 80.2k
- - Watching: 1.5k
