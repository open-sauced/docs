*Today is day 20 of my 29 Days of Open Source Alternatives series, where I'll be exploring open source alternatives to proprietary software in the categories of Game Development and Multimedia, Development Tools and Platforms, Productivity and Collaboration Tools, and more. If you'd like to see the list of the open source alternatives I'll be covering this month, head over to my [29 Days of Open Source Alts Page](https://oss.fyi/oss-alts). This post is in the Content Management and Publishing category.*

I've recently been on the hunt for a newsletter provider for a new project I'm working on, and I know my teammate @nickytonline [has been thinking about it too](https://dev.to/nickytonline/newsletters-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-43g4). Before starting at OpenSauced, I wasn't familiar with Ghost, but now I've sent out 21 issues you could say that I know my way around. (The next issue drops the first Monday of March, so if you want to check out what I learned from 29 Days of OSS Alternatives, you can [sign up here](https://news.opensauced.pizza/?v=1708356871467#/portal/signup).)
