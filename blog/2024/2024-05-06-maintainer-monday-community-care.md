description: It's maintainer month and we're celebrating some of our favorite maintainers! 
---

Last week, we kicked off Maintainer Month with [Enhancing Support for Open Source Maintainers](https://opensauced.pizza/blog/enhancing-support-for-open-source-maintainers). Now, we're continuing our love of maintainers with our Maintainer Monday post, shouting out some of our favorite maintainers and their projects.

This week, I'm choosing two maintainers from the X Spaces I've been doing for OpenSauced. I really learn a lot from my conversations with maintainers, but in both of these conversations I've returned to the wisdom they shared over and over again. Thank you, @danielroe and @bholmesdev for being guests and supporting the open source community. 


## [Daniel Roe](https://oss.fyi/danielroe)

Daniel brings his experience as a maintainer to Nuxt.js as leader of the core team. When we chatted, I really appreciated his focus on equipping other people to be able to grow and to support the project in different ways. Another part of the conversation that stood out to me was his desire to empower contributors. As part of that, he even offers time for contributors to book a call with him!

## [Ben Holmes](https://oss.fyi/benholmes)

Ben talked about being a Core maintainer for Astro and how he found that role. He shared a lot about how he sees the community and the importance of leaving a positive impact on the open source ecosystem. He shared his experience of shipping your personal open source projects without waiting for perfection.
