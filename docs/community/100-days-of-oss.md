Inspired by the great work of the [#100DaysOfCode challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/), we're starting #100DaysOfOSS. 

With this challenge, OpenSauced hopes to help developers enhance their skills, expand their abilities, and gain practical experience over 100 days, as well as support maintainers, onboard more contributors into open source, and expand the OSS community. With a focus on open source software (OSS), we encourage contributors of all technical backgrounds to immerse themselves in the world of collaborative development and engage with a supportive community.

## How to Participate
The beauty of this challenge is that you're not required to code. The main purpose is to grow in your understanding of open source software (OSS), contribute in ways that are meaningful to you, and further develop the skills and knowledge you're interested in pursuing. It's all about personal growth and making a positive impact on the OSS community. Because this challenge is focused on growth, you can participate in any way that helps you achieve your goals-including taking days off when you need it.

There are numerous ways to participate in the #100DaysOfOSS challenge, including:

- write issues to identify bugs or suggest new features;
- triage existing issues to help with prioritization;
- submit pull requests to contribute code changes;
- engage in the community by sharing your insights and knowledge;
- create or participate in discussions related to OSS topics;
- write a blog post or create content that supports an OSS project; 
- update or write documentation to improve clarity and usability
- create content: give a talk or presentation on OSS, participate in or even start a Twitter Space write a blog post or create a video;  
- maintain a project: review pull requests, triage issues, and respond to questions;
- support contributors working on OSS projects, providing guidance and support.

To keep track of your progress, post on social media, your blog, or any other platform you prefer with what progress you made, the day of the challenge indicated by 'D'and include the hashtag #100DaysOfOSS. For example, if you're on day one, you could say, "Today, I reviewed the documentation for the [OpenSauced/Insights](https://github.com/open-sauced/insights) repository. D1 #100daysOfOSS." Then, on day two, you would continue with D2, and so on.
