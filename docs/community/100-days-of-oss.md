Inspired by the great work of the [#100DaysOfCode challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/), we're starting #100DaysOfOSS.

With this challenge, OpenSauced hopes to help contributors enhance their skills, expand their abilities, gain practical experience over 100 days, support maintainers, onboard more contributors into open source, and expand the open source community. With a focus on open source software (OSS), we encourage contributors of all technical backgrounds to immerse themselves in the world of collaborative development and engage with a supportive community.

## How to Participate

The beauty of this challenge is that you're not required to code. The main purpose is to grow in your understanding of open source software (OSS), contribute in ways that are meaningful to you, and further develop the skills and knowledge you're interested in pursuing. It's all about personal growth and making a positive impact on the OSS community. Because this challenge is focused on growth, you can participate in any way that helps you achieve your goals, including taking days off when you need it.

There are numerous ways to participate in the #100DaysOfOSS challenge, including:

### Content Creation

Love creating content? Here's how you can use this skill for the challenge:

- Give a talk or presentation on OSS.
- Participate in or even start an X Space.
- Write a blog post or create a video about OSS.

- Submit pull requests to contribute code changes.

### Tracking Your Progress

To keep track of your progress, post on social media, your blog, or any other platform you prefer with:

- progress you made,
- the day of the challenge indicated by 'D',
- the hashtag #100DaysOfOSS.

For example, if you're on day one, you could say, "Today, I reviewed the documentation for the [OpenSauced/App](https://github.com/open-sauced/app) repository. D1 #100daysOfOSS." Then, on day two, you would continue with D2, and so on.

Here's what you can do if you're ready to join this challenge:

- [Post your commitment today on X](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%27m%20joining%20the%20%23100DaysOfOSS%20challenge%20with%20%40saucedopen%20to%20grow%20my%20skills%2C%20gain%20real-world%20experience%20in%20open%20source%2C%20and%20to%20make%20a%20positive%20impact%20on%20the%20OSS%20Community!) or share on your platform of choice!

Your OpenSauced Profile, includes your DevCard, which is a great way to track your progress. Remember, it's not about what the number is today; it's about what the number is at the end of 100 days. Check out [Numbers and Narratives: The Dual Power of Tracking Your Open Source Journey](https://opensauced.pizza/blog/numbers-and-narratives) for more information on effectively tracking your progress and telling your story.

#### How to check your OSCR
