The Dev card feature is what we like to call your "open source business card". It displays the amount of pull requests you create, repositories you contribute to, and how often you are active in the community. Whether you are a person who's just beginning their open source journey or a maintainer looking for more contributors and/or sponsors, the dev card is a great way to show your audience how active you are in the community.
