1. **How do I find good first issues?**
 we recommend checking out sites like [good first issues](https://goodfirstissues.com/) and [first timers only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/). they will lead you to projects and issues worth working on.  we also recommend using the `good first issue` label in the search engine of the project you want to contribute to. check out [this youtube short from github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3l_rurkoxg) to learn more. furthermore, check out our daily "who's looking for open source contributors?" on [dev.to](https://dev.to/opensauced/whos-looking-for-open-source-contributors-week-46-247i)
1. **My contribution does not show up on my Opensauced profile. how do I fix it?**
we suggest creating a [insight page](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source.md#discovering-open-source-with-opensauced) or adding your merged pull request to [the highlights page](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/06-the-secret-sauce.md#develop-your-open-source-resume).

1. **I want to find "x" language or frameworks data. How do I find it?**
post your suggestion in our [feedback repository](https://github.com/orgs/open-sauced/discussions). we'd love to see it! :smile:
