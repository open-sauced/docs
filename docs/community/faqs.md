1. **How do I find good first issues?**
We believe that [good first issues don't exist](https://opensauced.pizza/blog/good-first-issues-dont-exist), and the best way to find an issue to work on is to create the issue yourself. 

  However, sites like [good first issues](https://goodfirstissues.com/) and [first timers only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/) can lead you to projects and issues worth working on.  You can also use the `good first issue` label in the search engine of the project you want to contribute to. Check out [this guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-find-good-first-issues-on-github/) by our Triage Team member, Christine Belzie, to learn more.
