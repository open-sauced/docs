## I want to join Hacktoberfest, but I have no idea what open source is

No problem! ðŸ˜„ Here is a list of resources we recommend for first-time contributors:

- Take our [Intro to Open Source](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/) course to learn the history of open source, the tools to succeed in the community, and how to showcase your contributions.

## What should I expect during Hacktoberfest?

During Hacktoberfest, expect to feel excited and a bit competitive on your quest to submit your four pull requests. While those feelings are understandable, it's important to remember the following:

- Think first, work later: It's best to share your ideas and/or request to work on an issue before submitting a pull request. It'll make it easier for maintainers to assess whether your suggestion fits in with their project. It will also help you develop your communication skills.
- Be patient: Maintainers are people with lives outside of open source, so avoid constantly messaging them about when your pull request be reviewed and merged.
- Try new things: While revising typos is helpful, it's best to diversify contributions. This would help expand your skills, which is very useful if you plan on using your Hacktoberfest contributions as samples for your portfolio.
