The Highlights feature is what we like to call the "glitzy pepperoni" of your OpenSauced profile. It's the place where you can display your favorite open source contributions whether it's an article you wrote for [Codecademy's Docs website](https://www.codecademy.com/pages/contribute-docs), revising one of the lessons on [freeCodeCamp's curricula](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/#/index?id=learning-platform), or creating a tutorial for people who use [Audacity](https://support.audacityteam.org/community/contributing/tutorials).

The Highlights feature is what we like to call the "glitzy pepperoni" of your OpenSauced profile. It's the place where you can display your favorite open source contributions, share the story, and inspire others to join you in your open source journey. For maintainers, it's a great way to showcase your project, the issues that need support, and attract new contributors.

There are currently three types of highlights you can add to your profile: 
1. a Dev.to blog post
2. a Pull request
3. a issue
