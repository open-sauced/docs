### Writing an Effective Highlight

Showing your contributions is one thing but writing about them is crucial to attract potential collaborators and recruiters. Here are some tips to help you write effective descriptions about your highlights:

#### Highlighting Issues

1. **Summarize the problem**: Briefly describe the problem the project is currently facing. This helps other contributors or recruiters gain a better understanding of the situation.
2. **Describe the impact:** Briefly state how the problem negatively impacts the project. This would exemplify the issue's significance and your planning skills to recruiters and contributors who are looking for others to collaborate with.
3. **Describe a possible solution**: Mention the solution that you are considering to use to solve the issue. This would help display your problem solving skills to recruiters and people who are looking for potential maintainers to aid them in sustaining their projects.

#### Highlighting PRs

1. **Describe the problem**: Start with a clear summary of the problem that your PR addresses. This could be a bug, code needing to be more accessible, or enhancing a feature.
2. **Highlight your solution and its impact**: Explain the changes you made and how they solve the problem and effect the project. For instance, adding an AI summarizer to the project's Chrome Extension makes it easier for people to quickly summarize their content. This can help show recruiters that you bring results.
3. **Reflect on your experience**: Mention what you learned from working on the PR. For example, how to import images on with React.

#### Highlighting Dev.to Blog Posts

1. **Describe the topic**: Begin with an interesting summary of your blog post, helping your peers and recruiters understand what you've written.
2. **Discuss the inspiration**: Explain why this blog post is created. Is it to guide others on how to improve their coding skills, raise awareness about an issue in the tech community, or display your progress in learning a new programming language?
3. **End with a call-to-action**: Encourage readers to read and engage with the post, whether by commenting or sharing it with others on social media.
