## Introduction to OpenSauced for Contributors

OpenSauced is a platform dedicated to empowering you, the contributor, in your open source journey. With OpenSauced, you can use to find repositories to contribute to, track your contributions, gain insights into your favorite open source projects, and find new open source contributors to connect with. 

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to create an account on OpenSauced. You can do this by visiting the [app.opensauced.pizza](https://app.opensauced.pizza) and clicking the "Connect with GitHub" button. You will be prompted to sign in with your GitHub account. Once you have signed in, you will be redirected to the OpenSauced dashboard. A great place to get started is by creating your profile.

## Creating Your Profile

Creating your profile is a great way to showcase your open source contributions and connect with other contributors and maintainers. Here are some steps to help you get started:

1. After creating your account, navigate to Settings.
![settings](../../static/img/settings.png)

2. Once there, you will be asked to add your name, bio, links to your social media accounts, timezone, and other forms of contact information. 
  
  > **Tip:** Don't forget to add your personal site, GitHub Sponsors URL, and LinkedIn so people can connect with you and learn more about your work.
3. Add your interestes. In the Interests section, select the various programming languages and topics that you are interested in. This helps us recommend open source projects to you that fit your interests. 
4. Manage your email preferences. 

### Your Profile

Your profile is a great resource for showcasing your contributions and sharing with others the open source work you've done. 

![your profile](../../static/img/profile.png)

On your profile, you will see the Highlights section, which you can learn more about [here](../contributors-guide.md#highlights:connecting-and-recognizing-contributions), and three other tabs:
- **Contributions**: This tab includes a graph that shows the amount of Pull Requests you have opened, [the velocity of your Pull Requests](../welcome/glossary.md#pr-velocity), and the amount of repositories that you have contributed to. Underneath the graph, there is a "Latest PRs" chart, which shows a list of current and recent Pull Requests. This tab is helpful if you want to showcase a steady and consistent open source contribution experience. 
- **Connections**: for pro accounts, you can reach out to other contributors and maintainers to collaborate on projects or to learn from them.  
- **Recommendations**: This tab includes a list of open source projects that are chosen based the programming languages you picked in the Interests section of your public profile. This is useful if you're looking for new projects to contribute to.

## Explore Tab: Showcasing and Finding Projects for contributions

If you're looking for a new open source project to contribute to or you want to explore repositories for potential job opportunites, the Explore tab is a great place to start. Here, you can find a list of open source projects and filter them by language, top repos, recent, most active and more.

Once you've selected your filters, you'll be able to see the contributors, spam, and activity level of the repository. Understanding the activity level and PR velocity of a repository can help you determine if it's a good fit for you to contribute to and what to expect when you submit a PR.

For example, if you wanted to look for a JavaScript project to contribute to, you would select "JavaScript" from the language dropdown and "Most Active" from the filter dropdown. This would show you the most active JavaScript projects on GitHub.

## Highlights: Connecting and Recognizing Contributions

Leveraging OpenSauced's [Highlights](../features/highlights.md) feature is a great way for you to showcase your valuable contributions to your favorite open source projects. You can curate and share your contribution achievements and milestones and bring visibility to your hard work.

Highlights feature allows to:

- List issues that you raised to spot bugs, request a feature, or improve documentation.
- Share Dev.to blog posts that you've written.
- Display PRs that show your various tech skills.

### Creating a New Highlight

There are two ways to create a new highlight:

1. Paste the URL to your PR, Issue, or Dev.to blog post (shown in blue below).
2. Choose from a list of suggestions (shown in orange below).

![highlight suggestions](../../static/img/highlights.png)

If you're adding a blog post, you'll need to associate it to a repository by clicking the "Add a repo" button.

Finally, it's time to add the details of your highlight. You can write the description yourself or use the auto-summarize button to generate one.

### Writing an Effective Highlight

Showing your contributions is one thing, but writing about them is crucial to attracting potential collaborators and recruiters. Here are some tips to help you write effective descriptions of your highlights:

#### Highlighting Issues

1. **Summarize the problem**: Briefly describe the problem the project is currently facing. This helps other contributors or recruiters gain a better understanding of the situation.
2. **Describe the impact:** Briefly state how the problem negatively impacts the project. This would exemplify the issue's significance and your planning skills to recruiters and contributors who are looking for others to collaborate with.
3. **Describe a possible solution**: Mention the solution you consider using to solve the issue. This would help display your problem-solving skills to recruiters and people who are looking for potential maintainers to aid them in sustaining their projects.

#### Highlighting PRs

1. **Describe the problem**: Start with a clear summary of the problem that your PR addresses. This could be a bug, code needing to be more accessible, or enhancing a feature.
2. **Highlight your solution and its impact**: Explain your changes and how they solve the problem and affect the project. For instance, adding an AI summarizer to the project's Chrome Extension makes it easier for people to summarize their content quickly. This can help show recruiters that you bring results.
3. **Reflect on your experience**: Mention what you learned from working on the PR. For example, how to import images with React.

#### Highlighting Dev.to Blog Posts

1. **Describe the topic**: Begin with an interesting blog post summary to help your peers and potential recruiters understand your writing.
2. **Discuss the inspiration**: Explain why you wrote this blog post. Is it to guide others on improving their coding skills, raise awareness about an issue in the tech community, or display your progress in learning a new programming language?
3. **End with a call-to-action**: Encourage readers to read and engage with the post, whether by commenting or sharing it with others on social media.

## Insights: Connecting Your Repositories

OpenSauced [Insights](../features/insights.md) allows you to see the impact of your contributions. You can use Insights Pages to track repositories' growth, analyze work, and connect with others.

### Why Create an Insights Page

- **Tracking personal contributions**: Add repositories you contributed to and track your contributions.
- **Building portfolios and developing skills**: Contributing to open source projects can be a great way to develop new skills. Your contributions can also be used as samples for your portfolio. Looking for ways to implement your open source experience in your job search journey? Check out our [job search guide](../job-seekers-guide/introduction.md)!
- **Identifying potential projects to contribute to**: Finding open source projects to contribute to can be difficult. The Insights feature can help you identify projects to contribute to.
- **Networking and community engagement**: Finding people to work and connect with can be challenging. Through the feature's Contributors tab, you can quickly grow your network.
- **Curating collections for interest groups**: You can curate and share repositories focusing on sectors and programming languages that interest you. For example, @CBID2 created [a page of projects led and founded by women](https://app.opensauced.pizza/pages/CBID2/288/dashboard?range=30).

### Creating a New Insight Page

To connect your repositories, click the "Insights" tab on the dashboard. You will be redirected to a page where you can create your new Insight Page.

There are two ways to add repositories to your Insight Page:

1. **Sync GitHub organization**: Syncing your favorite GitHub organizations is a good idea if you want to keep track of their open source project activities and trends.
2. **Connect individual repositories**: Connecting individual repositories is a good idea if you want to keep track of the contributions of a specific repository or group of repositories. For example, you might want to track projects you have contributed to or would like to contribute to in the future.

![sync insights gif](../../static/gif/insight-page-demo.gif)

### Using Your Insights Page

Once you have connected your repositories, you will be redirected to your Insight Page. Here, you will see a dashboard with an overview of the repositories and the contributors who have contributed to them.

There are three tabs that provide you with more information on these repositories:

#### Reports

The Reports tab allows paid users to filter for more information about their repositories over the last 30 days and to generate a downloadable CSV. These filters include: Top 100 Repos, Minimum 5 Contributors, Recent, Most Active, and Spammed. This can be helpful if you're a contributor who is looking for mentors, someone to collaborate with, and review a contributor's merged or closed pull requests to get an idea on what to do and avoid when contributing to the same project. It can also be useful for finding the top open source projects that suit your needs and interests.

#### Repositories

If you're looking for an active project to contribute to, this tab can help you as it contains information such as Activity, PR Overview, PR Velocity, Spam, Contributors, and activity that has occurred over the last 30 days. This information is also a good way to connect with others on the project or where to find support. To learn more about these features, see [Understanding Insights Data](../maintainers/understanding-insights.md).

![repositories tab](../../static/img/repos-insights.png)

#### Contributors

The Contributors tab allows you to view more detailed information about other contributors, including Activity, Repositories, the date of their last contribution, Time Zone, and the number of contributions. This can be a great way to find other people to collaborate with or recommend for jobs.

Want to learn more about your peers?  You can select them and add them to a list.

![contributors insight list](../../static/img/contributors-insights.png)

There are two ways to add contributors to a list:

1. Create a new list with selected contributors.
2. Add selected contributors to an existing list.

## Lists: Connecting with Contributors

[Lists](../features/lists.md) feature helps you connect with other contributors or learn more about what others are up to in open source. With this feature, you can categorize, watch, and check out different groups of contributors within open source projects.

### What You Can Do With Lists?

## Using Your List

Once you have created your list, you will be redirected to your List Page. Here, you will see a dashboard with an overview of the contributors.

There are three tabs that provide you with more information on these repositories:

### Overview

The Overview tab gives you a high-level view of the contributors in your list, including the total number of commits in the last 30 days and the types of contributors on your list: Active, New, and Alumni. This can be helpful for finding people to collaborate with or individuals to learn from.

### Activity

The Activity tab gives you a graph view with more detailed information on each contributor, including the type of activity, repositories they've contributed to, and how they compare to each other.

You can filter your list by All Contributors, Active Contributors, New Contributors, and Alumni Contributors. This could be useful if you're new to the open source community and looking for potential mentors or an experienced contributor who is looking for people to collaborate with.

![list graph](../../static/img/list-graph.png)
