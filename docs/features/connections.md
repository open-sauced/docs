## How do Connections Work?

- **Sending connection requests**: Once you identify users you'd like to connect with, you can send them a connection request.
- **Acceptance**: Upon acceptance of your connection request, both parties become 1st-degree connections.
- **Following highlights**: After becoming 1st-degree connections, you can follow each other's highlights, keeping up-to-date with accomplishments, contributions, and other notable activities.
- **Contact information**: Post-acceptance, you'll have access to contact information to foster direct communication and ongoing dialogue.
