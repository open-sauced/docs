The Insights feature is your one-stop solution for understanding the pulse of your open-source projects and contributions. This feature is designed to provide a comprehensive view of your project's health and your individual contributions. From contribution trends to community health, OpenSauced Insights helps you make data-driven decisions that align with your goals. It's not just about numbers; it's about providing data to help you make decisions that can define your approach to open source and tell the story of your project or contribution journey.
