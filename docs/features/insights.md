The Insights feature is your one-stop solution for understanding the pulse of your open source projects and contributions. This feature is designed to provide a comprehensive view of your project's health and your individual contributions. From contribution trends to community health, OpenSauced Insights helps you make data-driven decisions that align with your goals. It's not just about numbers; it's about providing data to help you make decisions that can define your approach to open source and tell the story of your project or contribution journey.

## Sharing your your insight page with your teammates

After you've created your insights page, share it with your team.
An insight page is a dashboard containing selected repositories that you and your team can get insights from.
The Insights page provides a centralized and detailed overview of our open-source projects, offering valuable data on contribution trends, community health, and project milestones. By sharing this page with teammates, it ensures that everyone is well-informed about the project's status and can collaborate more effectively. This shared understanding fosters a collaborative environment where team members can align their efforts, make informed decisions, and collectively work toward the organization's success.
