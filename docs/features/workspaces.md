In the OpenSauced app, your work unfolds within a Workspace, a virtual environment designed to organize information for yourself, collaborating as a team, or operating across an entire company. Workspaces are a place to share, collaborate, and track open source projects and  contributors.

## Understanding Workspaces

You can navigate your workspaces from the sidebar. Each workspace has its own dashboard, which includes a list of repositories and contributors, as well as settings for the workspace.

### The Sidebar

The expandable sidebar includes:

 - Options for creating and viewing workspaces.
 - Access to your Contributor and Repository Insights pages.
 - Links to support.

 We recently had a naming change. The Contributors Insights section was previously called [Lists](lists.md), and the Repositories Insights section was previously called [Insights](./repo-insights.md).

### Your Workspaces

In your workspace dashboards, you can create, view, and manage your workspaces. You'll notice three dashboards in your Workspaces: 

- **Repositories**: This dashboard allows you to view and manage the repositories in this Workspace. 
- **Contributors**: This dashboard is where you can view and manage the contributors in this Workspace.
- **Settings**: This dashboard is where you can view and manage the settings in this Workspace, including adding repostories and contributors to your workspace and deleting the workspace.

#### Repositories Dashboard

Within the repositories dashboard, you can view the following metrics, which are over a period of thirty days by default:

- **Pull Requests**: This includes the total Opened and Merged Pull Requests for the repositories included in your workspace, as well as the velocity of pull requestions being merged.
- **Issues**: This includes the total Opened and Closed Issues for the repositories included in your workspace, as well as the velocity of issues being closed.
- **Engagement**: This includes the total stars, forks, and health for the repositories included in your workspace, as well as the health of these metrics.

#### Contributors Dashboard

## How to Create or Access a Workspace

To create a workspace, start by accessing the **Workspace switcher** in the sidebar. From there, you can create a new workspace or view an existing one.

### How to Add Repositories and Contributors to a Workspace

If you're creating a new workspace, you'll have the option to add repositories at the time of creation.

Start by creating a Workspace name, and then click `Add repositories`. You'll have three options for adding repositories:

1. **Search for Repositories**: Use our search tool by adding an organization name, followed by the repository name and add them to your workspace.
2. **Import a GitHub Organization**: Connect to your GitHub organizations to create a workspace from an organization.
3. **Import Repositories**: Paste a list of repositories to add to your workspace.

Once your repositories are added, you'll be able to see your repository dashboard.
