OpenSauced provides guidance for new contributors finding their next contribution. Our approach towards onboarding offers a way to track contributions through a GitHub powered dashboard.

## Highlights

The Highlights feature is what we like to call the "glitzy pepperoni" of your OpenSauced profile. It's the place where you can display your favorite open source contributions whether it's an article you wrote for [Codecademy's Docs website](https://www.codecademy.com/pages/contribute-docs), revising one of the lessons on [freeCodeCamp's curricula](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/#/index?id=learning-platform), or creating a tutorial for people who use [Audacity](https://support.audacityteam.org/community/contributing/tutorials).

Eager to get started? Check out[the Effectively Highlights section in our free "Intro to Open Source" course](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/06-the-secret-sauce.md#effectively-highlight-your-contributions) to learn more.
