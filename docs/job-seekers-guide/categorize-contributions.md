It is important to keep track of your open source contributions and show the impact you have left on the projects and organizations. By organizing your work, you will be able to talk about these meaningful contributions on your resume and in job interviews.

In this guide, we have created a table that you can use to categorize and keep detailed notes for each contribution you have made. We will break down each of these table components and talk about how to use this in your resume and job profile, and you can see a full example at the end of this guide.

## Personal Information

In this section of the table, you can include information like your name, email, GitHub profile, LinkedIn profile, OpenSauced profile, blog, etc. When it comes to the professional profiles, think about which profiles you want to show off to employers that highlights your skills and experience relevant to the types of jobs you are interested in.

| **Section**              | **Details** |
| ------------------------ | ----------- |
| **Personal Information** |             |
| Name                     |             |
| Contact Information      |             |
| LinkedIn                 |             |
| GitHub profile           |             |
| OpenSauced profile       |             |

## Career Goals

If you are new to the industry, you will want to list out which area of tech you are interested in pursuing. If you are looking for your next tech role, then you can list your current role or the role you wish to switch to.

If you are looking to level up in your role, you should list it in this section and list out the key skills required for that next level. You should also link to a few job posts to get an idea of key skills are required for that next level you are working towards.

| **Section**               | **Details**                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Career Goals**          |                                              |
| Desired Job Role          | [Your Desired Role]                          |
| Desired Job level         | [Junior, Mid, Senior, etc]                   |

## Matching Job Requirements to Your Current Skills

A common mistake for many job seekers is to send out the same resume template to all jobs. But in today's tech market it is important to stand out and tailor your resume to match your skills with the requirements listed.

In the previous section, you identified desired roles and key skills needed for those jobs. When you are reading through job descriptions, you will want to identify key skills that are repeatedly mentioned and add that to your career goals section.

As you fill out the remaining sections for project contributions, check to see if the contributions match the common skills requested in those jobs. If not, then you have just identified a skill gap and will need to find projects and issues that will allow you to strengthen those skills.

## Finding Open Source Projects to Contribute to

After you have filled out the career section of the table, you will want to find open source projects that align with your goals. You can use the explore feature on OpenSauced to explore new repositories in a variety of topics like [JavaScript](https://app.opensauced.pizza/javascript/dashboard/filter/recent?range=30), [Python](https://app.opensauced.pizza/python/dashboard/filter/recent?range=30), and [Machine learning](https://app.opensauced.pizza/ml/dashboard/filter/recent?range=30).

![Explore Machine Learning projects in OpenSauced](../../static/img/ml-explore-page.png)

Finding a good project to contribute to takes time. So make sure to look at the frequency of contributions to the project and the types of issues and features the project needs help with. If it aligns with your career goals, then start off with smaller issues and then move to larger features over time. You will also want to join the project's community chat room or Discord channel to connect with other contributors and core team members of the project.

## Open Source Project Contribution

In this next section, you will want to list out the meaningful contributions you have made to different open source projects. This can include documentation, code features, bug fixes, etc. Remember that, you will want to list out meaningful contributions that match the goals you laid out earlier.

### Basic Project Information

For each project contribution, you will want to list out the project name along with the PR and issue links. Then you will want to describe in a few short sentences why you chose this project and how it will help you with your career goals.

| **Section**          | **Details**                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Project Name         | [Project Name]                                 |
| Project URL          | [Project URL]                                  |
| Why This Project?    | [Reasons for Choosing This Project]            |
| Type of Contribution | [Code, Documentation, Community Support, etc.] |

### Learn and Development

Once your contribution has been approved and merged into the project, you will want to reflect on what you have learned during this process. What types of new skills or technologies did you learn while working on this issue? What challenges did you face? How did you interact with the community when you needed clarification on an issue or needed help with the pull request?

Keeping track of this information is helpful because you can reference these experiences later when crafting your resume. Potential employers will want to see how you work with others, how you problem solve and how you deliver solutions in a project.

Feel free to link to the pull request and issue discussions as references on how you worked with contributors in this project.

| Community Interaction        | [Meetups, Discussions, etc.]    |

### Contribution Tracking

| **Section**                           | **Details**                          |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |

### Using the Highlights Feature to Track Your Contributions

The [Highlights feature](../features/highlights.md) is the place you can display your favorite open source contributions, and share your open source story.

![OpenSauced Highlights](../../static/gif/highlight.gif)

You can use this feature to help you track the open source contributions that you are most proud of and share your accomplishments with your network. All of your highlights will appear on your OpenSauced profile, so sharing your profile is another way to let potential employers see the types of contributions you've made and the highlight you've identified as the most important.

### Using the Contributor Insight Feature to Follow People 

The [Contributor Insights feature](../features/contributor-insights.md) enables you to categorize, monitor, and analyze different groups of contributors within open source projects.

You can use this feature to create a list of people you interacted with during your open source work. If you continually work with the same individuals, then they can act as referrals and references for jobs.

Contributor Insights can also be used to track other people in your network to reach out to about their contributions.

### Using the Repository Insights Feature to Track the Repositories You Contributed to

### Networking and Professional Development

Some larger features can lead to networking and other professional development opportunities, like speaking at meetups or writing for tech publications. It is important that you list out who you mainly corresponded with for each contribution and any opportunities that came from this contribution.

If you have corresponded with the same core contributors and maintainers over the past few contributions, try reaching out about collaborating on other projects together. You never know where an opportunity will lead.

| **Section**                                 | **Details**                        |

You can easily share your Dev card on social media platforms like X/Twitter and LinkedIn to gain attention from potential recruiters and hiring managers.

### Reflection and Next Steps

In this section, you will want to reflect on what went well with this contribution and areas in which you struggled with.

It is important to tie these reflections back to your career goals and desired job roles you defined earlier. If you are weaker in skills that are required for the jobs are seeking, use future open source contributions as a way to strengthen these skills.

A lot of recruiters and hiring managers are on the look out for talented individuals on LinkedIn, so it is important to keep your profile up to date of your recent accomplishments.
