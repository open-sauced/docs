## When to grow your project

When it comes to deciding on whether your open source project is ready to grow, consider reviewing your project's [Repository Insights page](../features/repo-insights.md) and asking yourself the following questions:

- Are there tasks that are becoming too overwhelming for me and the team?
- How can I improve and maintain my project's current and pending features?
- How many stars and forks do I want to reach this time, and who can help me achieve it?

If you have said yes to these questions, it's time to develop your growth strategies. If you haven't already, consider creating different teams for specific purposes. For example, you can create a docs team for documentation maintenance, a triage team for reviewing and approving issues, or a maintainer team to help you with overall project oversight. Once you have decided the types of teams you want to add to your project, it's time to start building the open source team of your dreams.

## How to identify new contributors and team members

If you have a reliable group of contributors, adding them to a [Contributor Insight Page](../maintainers/maintainers-guide.md#creating-a-new-contributor-insight-page) can help you to better understand their contributions to your project and the open source ecosystem. Here are some methods you can use in this process:

- Monitor contributors to see if they are active enough in your repositories to contribute as a team member.
- Identify your top contributors to extend an invitation to join a team.
- Identify active contributors in other repositories who may be interested in joining your team.

## Recruiting Team Members and Contributors Outside of Your Project 

When you're ready to recruit your team members, consider creating a [Repository Insight Page](../features/repo-insights.md) with projects that are similar to yours. From there, determine which contributors suit your project, add them to a list, and monitor their progress.

Consider checking out our [Understanding Repository Insights Data](../features/repo-insights.md) guide to give you an idea on what to look for when narrowing down your list.

Once you've picked the people you want to join your project, recruit them. You can do this by going to their [OpenSauced profiles](../contributors/contributors-guide.md#creating-your-profile) and sending them a message via the contact information they provide.

## Understanding team participation

Once you have recruited your official team members, consider adding them to your project's Contributors Insights page by using [the team sync feature](../features/contributor-insights.md#how-to-create-a-contributor-insight-page). This can be useful in monitoring their progress.
