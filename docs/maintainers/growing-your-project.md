## Growing your project

Growth is the the crucial aspect of a successful open source project. If you're at this stage in your open source maintainer journey, here are some things to consider when thinking of growth strategies.

### When to grow your project

When it comes to deciding on whether your open source project is ready to grow, consider reviewing your project's repository insights page in its Workspace page and asking yourself the following questions:

- Are there tasks that are becoming too overwhelming for me and/or team?
- How can I improve and maintaining my project's current and pending features?
- How many stars and forks do I want to reach this time, and who can help me achieve it?
If you have said yes to these questions, it's time to develop your growth strategies. If you haven't already, consider creating different teams for specific purposes. For example, you can create a docs team for documentation maintenance, a triage team for reviewing and approving issues, or a maintainer team to help you with overall oversight of the project.  Once you have decided the types of teams you want to add to your project, you can create separate pages for each team in your project's Workspace page. Check out the [Creating a New Repository Insights Page](../docs/maintainers-guide.md#adding-repositories-to-your-workspace).

### How to identify new contributors and team members

When it comes to planning the growth strategies for your open source project, the people you bring on your team(s) and your project's contributors are key to its success, which is why picking the right people is important.  When doing this process, consider going to their OpenSauced profiles and checking their [dev card](../docs/features/dev-card.md). While you do this, ask yourself the following questions:

- How often do they contribute to yours and other open source projects in general?
- Are they invested in your project's success?

Once you have your list of potential candidates, [create an a contributor insights page for your project](../docs/features/contributor-insights.md), and add your candidates to the page. From there, monitor their progress.

After you finished your observations, consider narrowing down your list to the contributors that suit your criteria the most.

### Recruiting team members and contributors

When you're ready to recruit your team members, consider creating an [repository insights page](../docs/features/repo-insights.md) with projects that are similar to yours. From there, determine which contributors you think suits your project, add them to a list, and monitor their progress.

Consider checking our out [Understanding Repository Insights Data](../docs/features/understanding-repo-insights.md) guide to aid you in this process.

Once you've finished your observations, recruit them. You can do this by going to their OpenSauced profiles and sending them a message via the contact information they provide.

### Understanding team participation

Once you have picked your official team members, it is crucial to monitor their participation to ensure that they are help the project run efficiently.  You can do this by using [the team sync feature](../docs/features/contributor-insights.md#how-to-create-a-contributor-insight-page).
