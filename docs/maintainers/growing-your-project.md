## When to grow your project

When it comes to deciding on whether your open source project is ready to grow, consider asking yourself the following question:

- Are there active community members who would be interested in progressing to an official role?

If you have said yes, it's time to develop your growth strategies. If you haven't already, consider creating different teams for specific purposes. For example, you can create a docs team for documentation maintenance, a triage team for reviewing and approving issues, or a maintainer team to help you with overall project oversight. Once you have decided the types of teams you want to add to your project, it's time to start building the open source team of your dreams.

## How to identify new contributors and team members

When it comes to planning the growth strategies for your open source project, picking the right people will determine how successful your project will be. You can discover the right people for your project by starting with a [Repository Insight Page](../maintainers/maintainers-guide.md#creating-a-new-repository-insight-page). From there, you can use the Contributors dashboard to help you get a better understanding of your existing contributors.

Once you have found a reliable group of contributors, consider adding them to a [Contributor Insight Page](../maintainers/maintainers-guide.md#creating-a-new-contributor-insight-page). It can help you better understand their contributions to your project and the open source ecosystem. Here are some methods you can use to analyze the page:

- Monitor contributors to see if they are active enough in your repositories to contribute as a team member.
- Identify your top contributors to extend an invitation to join a team.
- Identify active contributors in other repositories who may be interested in joining your team.

## Recruiting Team Members and Contributors Outside of Your Project

When you're ready to recruit your team members, consider creating a [Repository Insight Page](../features/repo-insights.md) with projects that are similar to yours. From there, determine which contributors suit your project, add them to a list, and monitor their progress.  

:::tip

Consider checking out our [Understanding Repository Insights Data](../features/repo-insights.md) guide to give you an idea on what to look for when narrowing down your list.

Once you've identified the people you want to ask, reach out to them, providing a clear message and a list of expectations.

## Understanding team participation

Once you've identified the people you want to ask, reach out to them by providing a clear message and a list of expectations on how they should partake in the project. Then, [sync your team](../welcome/faqs.md#sync-your-github-team) to your project's Repository Insight page.

:::note

In order for the team sync feature to work, create the team on GitHub first. Check out [their tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/creating-a-team) to learn how.

When monitoring their progress in the [Contributors tab](../maintainers/maintainers-guide.md#contributors), here are some strategies you can use to help you:

- Identify the amount of repositories they contributed to in the Repositories section to see if they are immersed in the project.
- Take note of the date of their recent contribution in the Last Contributed section to see if it aligns with the number in the Repositories section.
- Check the level in the Act tab to determine how often they contribute to the project

:::tip

If you see "Low" in the Act tab, consider messaging your team member about this information and request a meeting to discuss possible strategies to help them progress.

## Creating Transparency and Communication With Your Team

While having a team is important in your open source project's growth strategy, the methods use to work and communicate with them plays a major role this journey. Creating and sharing your project's workspace with your team members can be a great way to help you facilitate this kind of environment for your project. Once you create this page, here are some strategies you can use its information to connect with your team:

- Analyze the closed number Pull Requests and Issues tabs and the PR velocity to think of new ways to quickly review and merge people's contributions.
- Use the amount of stars and forks displayed in the Engagement tab to discuss the effectiveness of current promotion strategies and to determine new methods to promote the project.
