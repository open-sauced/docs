## Growing Your Project
Growth is the the crucial aspect of a successful open source project. If you're at this stage in your open source maintainer journey, here are some things to consider when thinking of growth strategies.

### When to grow your project

When it comes to deciding on whether your open source project is ready to grow, consider reviewing your project's repository insights page in its Workspace page and asking yourself the following questions:
- Are there tasks that are becoming too overwhelming for me and/or team? 
- How can I improve and maintaining my project's current and pending features?
If you have said yes to these questions, it's time to develop your growth strategies. If you haven't already, consider creating different teams for specific purposes. For example, you can create a docs team for documentation maintainence, a triage team for reviewing and improving issues, or a maintainer team to help you with overall oversight of the project.  Once you have decided the types of teams you want to add to your project, you can create separate pages for each team in your project's Workspace page. Check out the [Creating a New Repository Insights Page](../docs/maintainers-guide.md#adding-repositories-to-your-workspace)
