## Growing your project

Growth is the the crucial aspect of a successful open source project. If you're at this stage in your open source maintainer journey, here are some things to consider when thinking of growth strategies.

### When to grow your project

When it comes to deciding on whether your open source project is ready to grow, consider reviewing your project's repository insights page in its Workspace page and asking yourself the following questions:

- Are there tasks that are becoming too overwhelming for me and/or team?
- How can I improve and maintaining my project's current and pending features?
- How many stars and forks do I want to reach this time, and who can help me achieve it?
If you have said yes to these questions, it's time to develop your growth strategies. If you haven't already, consider creating different teams for specific purposes. For example, you can create a docs team for documentation maintenance, a triage team for reviewing and approving issues, or a maintainer team to help you with overall oversight of the project.  Once you have decided the types of teams you want to add to your project, you can create separate pages for each team in your project's Workspace page. Check out the [Creating a New Repository Insights Page](../docs/maintainers-guide.md#adding-repositories-to-your-workspace).

### How to identify new contributors and team members

Like Superman, Wonder Woman, the Flash, and Batman in ***The Justice League***, the people you bring on your team(s) and your project's contributors are key to its success, which is why picking the right people is important.  When doing this process, consider going to their OpenSauced profiles and checking their [dev card](../docs/features/dev-card.md). While you do this, ask yourself the following questions:

- How often do they contribute to yours and other open source projects in general?
- Are they invested in your project's success?

Once you have your list of potential candidates, [create an Insights page for your project](../docs/maintainers-guide.md#creating-a-new-repository-insight-page), and add your candidates. From there, monitor their progress by reviewing the contributions that they post in the Highlights section. As you analyze this information, consider using the following questions to help with this step in your open source project's growth journey:

- How have they grown since you found their profile?
- What types of contributions does this person frequently make to yours and other open source projects?
From there, consider narrowing down your list to If you need more tips on how to pick people that can help grow your project, check out our blog post, ["How to Build Your Open Source Dream Team"](https://dev.to/opensauced/how-to-build-your-open-source-dream-team-a-guide-3i90).

### Recruiting team members and contributors

When you're ready to recruit your team members, consider creating an Insights page with projects that are similar to yours. From there, determine which contributors you think suits your project, add them to a list, and monitor their progress.  Once you've finished your observations, recruit them. You can do this by going to their OpenSauced profiles and sending them a message via the contact information they provide.

:::note If both of you have a PRO account, you can also send them invites using the [connections feature](../../docs/features-connections.md).

If you want to go beyond sending a direct message, here are some other ways to recruit new contributors and team members:

- Share your highlights about your project via Linkedin, X(Twitter), and other forms of social media
- Host events via Twitch or your project's Slack or Discord servers
- Join our "Pitch Your Project" space on X(Twitter).

### Understanding team participation

Once you have picked your official team members, it is crucial to monitor their participation to ensure that they are help the project run efficiently.  You can do this by using [the team sync feature](../docs/features/workspaces.md#team-workspaces).
