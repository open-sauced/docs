## Introduction to OpenSauced for Maintainers
OpenSauced is a platform dedicated to empowering maintainers and redefining open source contributions. We offer a GitHub-powered dashboard for tracking contributions and gaining insights into your open source projects. You can customize your Insights pages and lists with the repositories you choose and with the contributors you want to see. 

You can connect with your team and contributors through our platform and invite them to join OpenSauced. We also offer a GitHub browser extension that allows you to view your contributors' OpenSauced profiles and invite them to join OpenSauced with a single click.

## Getting Started
To get started, you will need to create an account on OpenSauced. You can do this by visiting [app.opensauced.pizza](https://app.opensauced.pizza) and clicking the "Connect with GitHub" button. You will be prompted to sign in with your GitHub account. Once you have signed in, you will be redirected to the OpenSauced dashboard.

## Insights: Connecting Your Repositories
OpenSauced Insights provides maintainers with a visual representation of their project's health and contributor engagement. It offers real-time data and analytics to understand contribution patterns, identify key contributors, and measure the project's growth. Insights can help you to assess team activity, understand when bottlenecks occur, identify where resource allocation is needed, plan and identify key contributors, understand contributor churn, or spot emerging trends.

Insights features allow you to:
- track the contributions of a specific team, a specific repository, or group of repositories
- view the number of pull requests that are open, closed, in draft, and merged
- view the average number of days it takes for a pull request to be merged (PR velocity)
- identify the top contributors to your project
- identify the current activity level and trends in activity of your contributors


### Creating a New Insight Page
To connect your repositories, click the "Insights" tab on the dashboard. You will be redirected to a page where you can create your new insight page.

There are two ways to add repositories to your Insight Page:
1. **Sync GitHub Organization**. Syncing your GitHub organization is a good idea for someone who seeks a comprehensive, unified view of your organization's open source project activities and trends, enabling streamlined management, strategic decision-making, and efficient allocation of resources across multiple repositories.
2. **Connect Individual Repositories**. Connecting individual repositories is a good idea for someone who wants to track the contributions of a specific repository or group of repositories. For example, you might want to track projects you maintain that are not under the same org or you may want to track projects that align with your team's objectives.

### Using Your Insights Page
Once you have connected your repositories, you will be redirected to your Insight Page. Here you will see a dashboard with an overview  of the repositories and the contributors who have contributed to them. 

There are three tabs that provide you with more information on these repositories.

#### Reports
The reports tab allows paid users to filter for more information about their repositories over the last thirty days and to generate a Downloadable CSV. Filters include: Minumum 5 Contributors, Recent, Most Active, and Spammed.

#### Repositories
The repositories tab allows you to view more detailed information on each of the repositories, including Activity, PR Overview, PR Velocity, Spam, Contributors, and activity over the last 30 days. To learn more about these features, see [Understanding Insights Data](#understanding-insights-data).
