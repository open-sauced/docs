# @open-sauced/semantic-release-conventional-config

## Description

The `npm` package `@open-sauced/semantic-release-conventional-config` is designed to help `npm` packages auto-release to `npm` or `ghcr` registries while generating github releases and changelog using conventional commit convention.

Version 2 supports alpha and beta pre-releases using coresponding branches.

## Dependencies

This package uses the following modules:

- [`conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog)
- [`@semantic-release/commit-analyzer`](https://github.com/semantic-release/commit-analyzer)
- [`@semantic-release/release-notes-generator`](https://github.com/semantic-release/release-notes-generator)
- [`@semantic-release/changelog`](https://github.com/semantic-release/changelog)
- [`@semantic-release/npm`](https://github.com/semantic-release/npm)
- [`@semantic-release/git`](https://github.com/semantic-release/git)
- [`@semantic-release/github`](https://github.com/semantic-release/github)
- [`@semantic-release-plus/docker`](https://github.com/semantic-release-plus/semantic-release-plus/tree/master/packages/plugins/docker)

## Installation

```shell
npm install --save-dev @open-sauced/semantic-release-conventional-config
```

Create a [release.config.js](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/configuration#configuration-file) file and populate it with the preset:

```shell
module.exports = {
 extends: '@open-sauced/semantic-release-conventional-config',
};
```

## Usage

Add `semantic-release` to the `scripts` section to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "semantic-release": "npx semantic-release"
  }
}
```

The reason why we provide `npx` in the `scripts` section is for the people using this as a development enhancement, interactive configurations or trimmed dependency trees, where using `npx` is preferred over installing all the dependencies at once.

In your release step run the `semantic-release` script now:

```shell
npm run semantic-release
```

You can skip the `scripts` section however `semantic-release` will still be a peer dependency of `@open-sauced/semantic-release-conventional-config`. 

Like that it is enough to just run this command in the workflow:

```shell
npx semantic-release
```

## Configuration

Set `DISABLE_DOCKER` to any value if you want to disable the docker docker plugin.

Set `private` to true in `package.json` if you want to disable `npm` releases.

An example leveraging `node` and `docker` build artifacts can be found in [open-sauced](https://github.com/open-sauced/open-sauced/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml). 

A few less inter dependent configurations will be described in the next section. 

## Workflow examples

### Node application

This example requires `"private": true,` in your `package.json` and simplifies the workflow to lightning fast deployment:

```yaml
release:
    environment:
      name: production
      url: https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/releases/tag/v${{ steps.release.outputs.version }}
    name: Semantic release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: "☁️ checkout repository"
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: "🔧 setup node"
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2.1.5
        with:
          node-version: 14

      - name: "🔧 setup cache"
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: ~/.npm
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/npm-shrinkwrap.json') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-node-

      - name: "🔧 install npm@latest"
        run: npm i -g npm@latest

      - name: "📦 install dependencies"
        run: npm ci

      - name: "🚀 static app"
        run: npm run build

      - name: "🚀 release"
        id: release
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          DISABLE_DOCKER: true
          GIT_AUTHOR_NAME: ${{ github.event.commits[0].author.username }}
          GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL: ${{ github.event.commits[0].author.email }}
        run: |
          npm run semantic-release
          echo "::set-output name=version::$(cat package.json | jq -r '.version')"
```

### Npm library

For `npm` libraries we need to set the environment URL manually and set a `NPM_TOKEN` environment variable. This also disables docker builds:

```yaml
name: "Release"

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  release:
    environment:
      name: npm
      url: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@open-sauced/semantic-release-conventional-config/v/${{ steps.release.outputs.version }}
    name: Semantic release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: "☁️ checkout repository"
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: "🔧 setup node"
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2.1.5
        with:
          node-version: 14

      - name: "🔧 setup cache"
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: ~/.npm
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-node-

      - name: "🔧 install npm@latest"
        run: npm i -g npm@latest

      - name: "📦 install dependencies"
        run: npm ci

      - name: "🚀 release"
        id: release
        env:
          DISABLE_DOCKER: true
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
          GIT_AUTHOR_NAME: ${{ github.event.commits[0].author.username }}
          GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL: ${{ github.event.commits[0].author.email }}
        run: |
          npm run semantic-release
          echo "::set-output name=version::$(cat package.json | jq -r '.version')"
```

### Docker image

For docker builds it's best to build your node application in parallel with the container and re-use the artifact at a later stage:

```yaml
name: "Release"

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  docker:
    name: Build container
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: "☁️ checkout repository"
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: "🔧 setup buildx"
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1

      - name: "📦 docker build"
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
        with:
          context: .
          tags: ${{ github.repository }}:latest
          outputs: type=docker,dest=/tmp/docker.tar
          push: false

      - name: "📂 docker artifacts"
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: docker
          path: /tmp/docker.tar

  build:
    name: Build application
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: "☁️ checkout repository"
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: "🔧 setup node"
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2.1.5
        with:
          node-version: 14

        with:
          path: ~/.npm
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/npm-shrinkwrap.json') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-node-

      - name: "🔧 install npm@latest"
        run: npm i -g npm@latest

### Pre-releases

This workflow requires the creation of `alpha` and `beta` protected branches while templating every commit to be conventional. It does not support squashing without creating extremely complex conflict resolution: 

```yaml
name: "Release"

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - beta
      - alpha

jobs:
  release:
    environment:
      name: npm
      url: https://www.npmjs.com/package/open-sauced-semantic-config-test/v/${{ steps.release.outputs.version }}
    name: Semantic release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: "☁️ checkout repository"
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: "🔧 setup node"
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2.1.5
        with:
          node-version: 14

      - name: "🔧 setup cache"
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: ~/.npm
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-node-

      - name: "🔧 install npm@7"
        run: npm i -g npm@7

      - name: "📦 install dependencies"
        run: npm ci

      - name: "🚀 release"
        id: release
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
          DISABLE_DOCKER: true
          GIT_AUTHOR_NAME: ${{ github.event.commits[0].author.username }}
          GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL: ${{ github.event.commits[0].author.email }}
        run: |
          npm run semantic-release
          echo "::set-output name=version::$(cat package.json | jq -r '.version')"
```

## FAQ

### Which assets are pushed to git

The following assets are added to git using `@semantic-release/git`:

```json
{
  "assets": [
      "CHANGELOG.md",
      "package.json",
      "package-lock.json",
      "npm-shrinkwrap.json",
      "public/diagram.svg"
  ]
}
```

### What is the commit convention

The following commit rules are enforced by `@semantic-release/commit-analyzer`:

```json
{
  "preset": "conventionalcommits",
  "releaseRules": [
    {"type": "build", "release": "minor"},
    {"type": "ci", "release": "patch"},
    {"type": "docs", "release": "minor"},
    {"type": "style", "release": "patch"},
    {"type": "refactor", "release": "patch"},
    {"type": "test", "release": "patch"},
    {"type": "revert", "release": "patch"},
    {"type": "chore", "release": false}
  ],
  "parserOpts": {
    "noteKeywords": ["BREAKING CHANGE", "BREAKING CHANGES", "BREAKING"]
  }
}
```

### How to enrich the static distribution

The following assets are packed into the github release download using `@semantic-release/github`:

```json
{
  "assets": [
    {
      "path": "pack/*.tgz",
      "label": "Static distribution"
    }
  ]
}
```

### How to start using pre-releases

Create the `alpha` and/or `beta` branches and protect them from being deleted or pushed to directly by non-administrators.

Switch your branching strategy to `merge` and enable conventional commits checking.

You will have to resolve merge conflicts between `alpha`, `beta` and `main` branches as described in the [semantic-releases recipes](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/tree/master/docs/recipes).
