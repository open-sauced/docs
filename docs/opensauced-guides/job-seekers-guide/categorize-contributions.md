It is important to keep track of your open source contributions and show the impact you have left on the projects and organizations. By organizing your work, you will be able to talk about these meaningful contributions on your resume and in job interviews.

In this guide, we have created a table that you can use to categorize and keep detailed notes for each contribution you have made. We will break down each table component and talk about how to use these in your resume and job profile. You can see a complete example at the end of this guide.

## Personal Information

In this section of the table, you can include information like your name, email, GitHub profile, LinkedIn profile, OpenSauced profile, blog, etc. When it comes to professional profiles, consider which profiles you want to show off to employers that highlight your skills and experience relevant to the types of jobs you are interested in.

| **Section**              | **Details** |
| ------------------------ | ----------- |
| **Personal Information** |             |
| Name                     |             |
| Contact Information      |             |
| LinkedIn                 |             |
| GitHub profile           |             |
| OpenSauced profile       |             |

## Career Goals

If you are new to the industry, you will want to list which area of tech you are interested in pursuing. If you are looking for your next tech role, you can list your current role or the role you wish to switch to.

If you want to level up your role, you should list the key skills required for that next level in this section. You should also link to a few job posts to get an idea of key skills are required for that next level you are working towards.

| **Section**               | **Details**                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Career Goals**          |                                              |
| Desired Job Role          | [Your desired role]                          |
| Desired Job level         | [Junior, Mid, Senior, etc.]                  |
| Key Skills to Develop     | [Skills to focus on]                         |
| Industry/Area of Interest | [Frontend, Backend, Fullstack, ML, AI, etc.] |
| Example Job Links         | [Link to desired jobs]                       |

## Matching Job Requirements to Your Current Skills

A common mistake for many job seekers is to send out the same resume template to all jobs. But in today's tech market, it is important to stand out and tailor your resume to match your skills with the requirements listed.

In the previous section, you identified desired roles and key skills needed for those jobs. When you are reading through job descriptions, you will want to identify key skills that are repeatedly mentioned and add that to your career goals section.

As you fill out the remaining sections for project contributions, check to see if the contributions match the common skills requested in those jobs. If not, then you have just identified a skill gap and will need to find projects and issues that will allow you to strengthen those skills.

## Finding Open Source Projects to Contribute to

After you have filled out the career section of the table, you will want to find open source projects that align with your goals. You can use the explore feature on OpenSauced to explore new repositories in a variety of topics like [JavaScript](https://app.opensauced.pizza/javascript/dashboard/filter/recent?range=30), [Python](https://app.opensauced.pizza/python/dashboard/filter/recent?range=30), and [Machine Learning](https://app.opensauced.pizza/ml/dashboard/filter/recent?range=30).

![Explore Machine Learning projects in OpenSauced](../../../static/img/ml-explore-page.png)

Finding a good project to contribute to takes time. So, make sure to look at the frequency of contributions to the project and the types of issues and features the project needs help with. If it aligns with your career goals, then start off with smaller issues before moving to larger features. You will also want to join the project's community chat room or Discord channel to connect with other contributors and core team members of the project.

## Open Source Project Contribution

In this next section, you will want to list your meaningful contributions to different open source projects. This can include documentation, code features, bug fixes, etc. Remember that you will want to list out meaningful contributions that match the goals you laid out earlier.

### Basic Project Information

For each project contribution, you will want to list the project name and the PR and issue links. Then, describe in a few short sentences why you chose this project and how it will help you with your career goals.

| **Section**          | **Details**                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Project Name         | [Project Name]                                 |
| Project URL          | [Project URL]                                  |
| Why This Project?    | [Reasons for choosing this project]            |
| Type of Contribution | [Code, documentation, community support, etc.] |

### Learn and Development

Once your contribution has been approved and merged into the project, you will want to reflect on what you have learned during this process. What new skills or technologies did you learn while working on this issue? What challenges did you face? How did you interact with the community when you needed clarification on an issue or help with the PR?

Keeping track of this information is helpful because you can reference these experiences later when crafting your resume. Potential employers will want to see how you work with others, solve problems, and deliver solutions in a project.

Feel free to link to the PR and issue discussions as references on how you worked with contributors in this project.

| Challenges Overcome          | [Challenges faced and resolved] |
| Community Interaction        | [Meetups, Discussions, etc.]    |

### Contribution Tracking

For each project contribution, you will want to list the date, a brief summary of the issue, and how you solved it. Also, list any acknowledgments you received from other contributors or core team members on the project because it highlights your impact.

| **Section**                           | **Details**                          |

You can use this feature to help you track the open source contributions you are most proud of and share your accomplishments with your network. All your highlights will appear on your OpenSauced profile. So, sharing your profile is another way to let potential employers see the types of contributions you've made and the highlights you've identified as the most important.

### Using the Contributor Insight Feature to Follow People

The [Contributor Insights feature](../../features/contributor-insights.md) enables you to categorize, monitor, and analyze different groups of contributors within open source projects.

You can use this feature to create a list of people you interacted with during your open source work. If you continually work with the same individuals, they can act as referrals and references for jobs.

Contributor Insights can also be used to track other people in your network to reach out to about their contributions.

### Networking and Professional Development

Some larger features can lead to networking and other professional development opportunities, like speaking at meetups or writing for tech publications. It is important that you list out who you mainly corresponded with for each contribution and any opportunities that came from this contribution.

If you have corresponded with the same core contributors and maintainers over the past few contributions, try reaching out about collaborating on other projects. You never know where an opportunity will lead.

| **Section**                                 | **Details**                        |

### Reflection and Next Steps

In this section, you will want to reflect on what went well with this contribution and the areas you struggled with.

Tying these reflections back to your career goals and desired job roles you defined earlier is important. If you are weaker in skills that are required for the jobs you are seeking, use future open source contributions as a way to strengthen these skills.
