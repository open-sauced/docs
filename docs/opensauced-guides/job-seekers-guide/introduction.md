When you are looking for a tech job, it is important to stand out amongst the sea of candidates. One great way to stand out and showcase your skills is through open source contributions.

Open source provides you the opportunity to showcase your code, documentation, communication, and collaboration skills to potential employers. You also have the ability to grow your professional network and build real connections within the tech industry through open source.

OpenSauced can help you craft an open source profile that is attractive to hiring managers and recruiters and help you land that next role.

In this guide, you will learn how to use OpenSauced features like your personal [Dev Card](../../features/dev-card.md), [Highlights](../../features/highlights.md), [Contributor Insights](../../features/contributor-insights.md), and [Repository Insights](../../features/repo-insights.md) to showcase your open source work and build connections to help you land a job.
