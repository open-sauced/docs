## Introduction to OpenSauced for Students

Welcome to the wonderful world of open source. As a student, you'll find countless opportunities to find contributing experiences, collaborate across global projects, and enhance your resume through meaningful contributions. You can use OpenSauced as a tool to enhance your open source journey by helping you to find interesting repositories that match your academic and personal interests, document your journey, learn from the community, and showcase your growth.

In this guide, you will learn how to use OpenSauced features like your personal [Dev Card](../../features/dev-card.md), [Highlights](../../features/highlights.md), [Contributor Insights](../../features/contributor-insights.md), and [Repository Insights](../../features/repo-insights.md) to showcase your open source work and build connections to help you meet your next goals.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to create an account on OpenSauced. You can do this by visiting the [app.opensauced.pizza](https://app.opensauced.pizza) and clicking the "Connect with GitHub" button. You will be prompted to sign in with your GitHub account. Once you have signed in, you will be redirected to the OpenSauced dashboard. The best place to get started is by creating your profile.

## Creating Your Profile

Creating your profile is a great way to showcase your open source contributions, connect with other contributors and maintainers, and share with your classmates, communities, and connections. Here are some steps to help you get started:

1. After creating your account, navigate to "Settings."

2. Once there, you will be asked to add your name, bio, links to your social media accounts, timezone, and other forms of contact information.

   :::tip

   Don't forget to add your personal site, GitHub Sponsors URL, and LinkedIn so people can connect with you and learn more about your work.

   :::

3. In the "Interests" section, select the various programming languages and topics you are interested in. Setting them helps us recommend open source projects that fit your interests.
4. Manage your email preferences.

### Your Profile

Your profile is a great resource for showcasing your contributions and sharing your open source work with others.

On your profile, you will see the "Highlights" tab, which you can learn more about [in this section](#highlights-connecting-and-recognizing-contributions). Other tabs you may find useful on your profile are: 

- **Contributions**: This tab includes a graph showing the number of PRs you have opened, [the velocity of your PRs](../../welcome/glossary.md#pr-velocity), and the number of repositories you have contributed to in the last thirty days. Underneath the graph is a "Latest PRs" chart, which shows a list of current and recent PRs. This tab is helpful if you want to showcase a steady and consistent open source contribution experience.
- **Recommendations**: This tab includes a list of open source projects that are chosen based on the programming languages you picked in the "Interests" section of your public profile. It is useful if you're looking for new projects to contribute to.

:::tip

Don't just share your profile, include in on things like your resume, LinkedIn, your GitHub Readme, and  your personal website to showcase your most up-to-date open source contributions.

### Your Dev Card

Another fun way to share your open source contributions is through your [Dev Card](../../features/dev-card.md). Your Dev Card is a visual representation of your open source contributions. It includes your profile picture, name, bio, and a list of your latest contributions.

## Explore: Finding Your Next Open Source Project

The "Explore" tab is a great place to start if you're looking for a new open source project to contribute to or want to find repositories for potential job opportunities. Here, you can find a list of open source projects and filter them by language, top repos, recent, most active, and more.

Once you've selected your filters, you'll be able to see the contributors, spam, and activity levels of the repository. Understanding a repository's activity level and PR velocity can help you determine if it's a good fit for you to contribute to and what to expect when you submit a PR.

For example, if you wanted to look for a JavaScript project to contribute to, you would select "JavaScript" from the language dropdown and "Most Active" from the filter dropdown to see the most active JavaScript projects on GitHub. If you want to keep track of the repositories you're interested in contributing to, you can select and add them to a [Repository Insights Page](../../features/repo-insights.md) or your [Workspace](../../features/workspaces.md).

## Highlights: Connecting and Recognizing Contributions

Leveraging OpenSauced's [Highlights](../features/highlights.md) feature is a great way for you to showcase your valuable contributions to open source projects. You can curate and share your achievements and milestones and bring visibility to your hard work.

The Highlights feature allows you to:

- talk about issues that you raised,
- share Dev.to blog posts that you've written,
- display Pull Requests that showcase your contributions.

### Creating a New Highlight

There are two ways to create a new highlight:

1. Paste the URL to your PR, issue, or Dev.to blog post (shown in blue below).
2. Choose from a list of suggestions (shown in orange below).

:::note

If you're adding a blog post, you'll need to associate it to a repository by clicking the "Add a repo" button.

:::

Finally, it's time to add the details of your highlight. You can write the description yourself or use the auto-summarize button to generate one.

### Writing an Effective Highlight

Sharing the story of your hard work is an opportunity to connect with the reader, which could include potential collaborators, other contributors, maintainers, or anyone on OpenSauced. Here are some tips to help you write effective stories for your highlights:

#### Highlighting Issues

1. **Share your motivation**: Briefly explain why you raised the issue. For example, "I'm passionate about improving accessibility because I believe everyone should have equal access to information."
2. **Summarize the issue**: Briefly describe the issue you wrote so your readers have context. For example, "I raised an issue to add alt text to images in the project's 'About Us' page."
3. **Describe the impact:** Briefly state how the resolution of the issue will improve the project. For example, "This will help people who use screen readers to understand the content better."

#### Highlighting PRs

1. **Describe the PR**: Start with a clear summary of what your PR accomplishes. For example, "I added a new feature to the project's Chrome Extension that allows users to summarize content."
2. **Highlight your solution and its impact**: Briefly describe the solution, any challenges you faced, or any part of the PR you're particularly proud of. For example, "Initially, I faced challenges with the API, but I was able to resolve them using a different endpoint."
3. **Reflect on your experience**: Mention what you learned from working on the PR. For example, "I learned a lot about the Chrome Extension API and how to use it to create new features."

#### Highlighting Dev.to Blog Posts

1. **Describe the topic**: Begin with an interesting blog post summary to help others to understand your writing.
2. **Discuss the inspiration**: Explain why you wrote this blog post. Is it to guide others on improving their coding skills, raise awareness about an issue in the tech community, or display your progress in learning a new programming language?
3. **End with a call-to-action**: Encourage others to read and engage with the post.
