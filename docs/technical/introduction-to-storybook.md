# Introduction to storybook

Storybook is being leveraged to mock out visual React components. The latest version of the design system can be found at this [URL](https://sauced-components.netlify.app/).

To run storybook, use this command:

```sh
npm run storybook
```

## UI categories

Storybook is broken into several categories:

<ul>
<li><b>Button:</b> These are the button elements that appear in the project in various forms. They primarily are the Button component in the project but can also be icons.</li>
<li><b>Cards:</b> These are the main container elements in the project. Each item represents a live component in their current form in the project.</li>
<li><b>Primitives: These are the basic styling of base HTML components.</b></li>
<li><b>Nav:</b> This is the main navigation bar for the project. There are two states, when there is no user logged in and when a user is logged in.</li>
<li><b>Footer:</b> This represents the various footers for the project.</li>
<li><b>Homepage:</b> This is the main component for the project homepage and shows the home page in its current form.</li>
<li><b>Miscellaneous:</b> These are components that currently don't fit neatly into the above categories.</li>
</ul>

    title: "*Name of category*"
};
