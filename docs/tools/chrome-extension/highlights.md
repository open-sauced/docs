If you're in GitHub, you can use the OpenSauced Chrome Extension to post a [highlight](highlights.md) of your pull requests to the OpenSauced website. 

You can access the post to highlight it from the popup window in the extension. When you click it, it will automatically, populate the PR title and you can provide the summary.

If your Highlight is successfully posted, you will get a message with an option to see the Highlight on the OpenSauced website.
