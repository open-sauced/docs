You can generate and post a Highlight of your PR or issue to your OpenSauced profile with our OpenSauced.ai Chrome extension.

A popup window will open when you click the extension button on your PR or issue page on GitHub. You can navigate to "Tools" at the bottom and select "Post Highlight". It will automatically populate the PR or issue title, and you can generate a summary of the Highlight.

![location of post to highlight](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18273833/241761099-e7a745c8-204e-4a4d-b313-867ab99af0b2.png)

If your Highlight is successfully posted, you will get a message with an option to see the Highlight on the OpenSauced website.

But if there is an error with the summarization, you will see it in the text area, as in the example below:
