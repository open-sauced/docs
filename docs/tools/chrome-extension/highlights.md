You can create a Highlight directly from the popup window in the OpenSauced.ai Chrome extension. When you click the extension button, it will automatically populate the PR or issue title. You can use our extension to get a summary of the Highlight, similar to the PR summary.

![location of post to highlight](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18273833/241761099-e7a745c8-204e-4a4d-b313-867ab99af0b2.png)

If your Highlight is successfully posted, you will get a message with an option to see the Highlight on the OpenSauced website.

But if there is an error with the summarization, you will see it in the text area, as the example below:
