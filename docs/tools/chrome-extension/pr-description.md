The OpenSauced Chrome extension will help you create a PR based on the configuration you have in the extension. It will enable you to create the summary based on either commit messages, the difference between the files, or both. You can even set the message's length and tone using the same settings.

_**Note**: This feature is not available on private repositories._

You can use these settings to set the strictness and the tone of the generated AI. Below is the explanation of the settings:

- **Description Length**: The output length.
- **Temperature**: The similarity between the input text and the output, higher temperature mean more randomness, lower temperature means more strict to the input.
- **Max Input Length.**
- **Description Language:** Right now, this feature supports: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian, Chinese, Korean.
- **Description Tone:** The tone of the output: Exciting, Persuasive, Informative, Humorous, Formal.
- **Description Source:** The source of the description that our AI will use to get the output it can be the next: **Commit Messages** or **The diff between the files** or **both**.
