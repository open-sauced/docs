## Contributor Insights

## Lottery Factor

The Lottery Factor is a metric that identifies how at risk a project is if a key contributor leaves. It is calculated by the percentage of pull request (PR) contributions made by the top contributors. If 50% of the PR contributions come from two or fewer contributors, the lottery factor is high. 

The name "Lottery Factor" comes from the idea that if a key contributor wins the lottery and leaves, the project is at risk. This is sometimes known as the [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor).

## New Contributors

A contributor who has recently made their first contribution to a project.
